# Digital-Code-Lock-System
 The aim of the "Digital Code Lock System" project is to create a strong and
 easy-to-use access control system. Imagine a high-tech lock for a room or building.
 This system ensures that only authorized people can enter while providing a
 straightforward experience for users.
